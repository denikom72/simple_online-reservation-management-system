Simple Prototyping Framework - Perl/Cgi, Javascript and Co.

Goal was to be able to prototype some functionalities fast to get some look-like-feeling. Helps to focus mostly on the business layer 
and db-queries. 

In this example it was used to prototype a
# simple_online-reservation-management-system
Management-System for online-reservations. You can set different capacities ( rooms, tables, .... ) and publishing it for reservations.

After downloading the project, you have to reconfigure the webserver ( apache2 ) and set the html-directory as html-document-root and cgi as a cgi-bin-folder.
